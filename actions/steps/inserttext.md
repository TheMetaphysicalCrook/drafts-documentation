title: Action Step â€“ Insert Text
---

{% include back.html title="Action Steps" path="/actions/steps" %}

Insert the output of a template at the current cursor position in the current draft. Can be used to insert any static or generated text.

*Insert text is best used only for keyboard row actions which are shortcuts to insert snippets of text.* They manipulate the editor only, not the underlying draft - so should not be used in combination with other steps which will rely on the inserted text.

- [Insert Tab](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E3)

#### Options

- **Template**: Template for content to insert.
