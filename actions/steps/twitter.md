title: Action Step â€“ Twitter
---

{% include back.html title="Action Steps" path="/actions/steps" %}

Post a tweet to Twitter. Use twitter steps with alternate identifiers to target multiple accounts.

#### Examples

- [Tweet](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E5)

#### Options

- **Template**: Template for the content of the file.
- **Identifier**: Arbitrary string identifier for the Twitter credentials to use. This value is only needed if you wish to use more than one account with Drafts. If used, all actions with the same identifier will use the same alternate login for Twitter.  The identifier can be any value, but something useful, like the twitter username, is helpful for identifying credentials in settings.
