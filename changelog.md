## 5.2.0

#### New in 5.2

- **Actions now have an "Assign tags" after success setting.** In addition to moving a draft to the archive or trash, after success can now also assign tags - great for marking or filing away drafts automatically when processing them. For example, set the Tweet action to automatically assign the "tweet" tag when run on a draft and you can later easily filter for tweets. [Details](http://getdrafts.com/actions/advancedsettings)
- **In-draft navigation to jump between key marks in longer drafts**. Accessed via the navigate button (down arrow icon) in the upper right (or âŒ˜-\ shortcut). Currently navigation supports jumping to headers in a Markdown draft, projects in a Taskpaper draft, and functions and "// #region Name" region comments in Javascript drafts. [Details](http://getdrafts.com/editor/navigation)
- **Scripting additions to support switching workspaces and action groups**:
  - Allows for action setup to load a workspace, and simultaneously switch selected action list and keyboard row.
  - Inquiry about and toggle visibility of drafts and action lists:
      - `app.isDraftListVisible`, `app.showDraftList()`, `app.hideDraftList()`
      - `app.isActionListVisible`, `app.showActionList()`, `app.hideActionList()`
  - Load action groups and apply workspaces in script:
      - `app.loadActionGroup(group)`, `app.loadKeyboardActionGroup(group)`
      - `app.applyWorkspace(workspace)`
  - Also Workspace and ActionGroup objects to allow lookup of groups and workspaces.
  - More details on [scripting reference site](http://reference.getdrafts.com)
- **Additional URL Actions**
  - `/loadActionGroup?name=GROUP-NAME` - loads action group in action list
  - `/loadKeyboardActionGroup?name=GROUP-NAME` - loads action group in extended keyboard.
  - Details in [URL scheme documentation](http://getdrafts.com/urls)
- **"List in Reminders" action step now has a template**. Useful to create one for sending only [[selection]] or passing in values from script or prompt. [Details](http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/listinreminders)
